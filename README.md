# Fork of Platformio Raspberry Pi RP2040: development platform for [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/platformio/platform-raspberrypi/workflows/Examples/badge.svg)](https://github.com/platformio/platform-raspberrypi/actions)

> [!NOTE]  
> This fork was created due to the lack of ongoing upstream development of the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and RP2350 Arduino Core for PlatformIO.

RP2040 is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller device with a large on-chip memory, symmetric dual-core processor complex, deterministic bus fabric, and rich peripheral set augmented with a unique Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem, it provides professional users with unrivalled power and flexibility. RP2040 was initially released as part of the Raspberry Pi Pico board.

RP2350 microcontroller is the successor to RP2040, and it contains two 32-bit ARM Cortex-M33 cores and two Hazard3 RISC-V cores. RP2350 was initially released as part of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 board.

# Usage

1. [Install PlatformIO](https://platformio.org)
2. **Enable Win32 NTFS Long Paths** if on Windows. Otherwise, the installation of the package files for Arduino-Pico **will** fail. See https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platformio.html#important-steps-for-windows-users-before-installing.
3. Create PlatformIO project and configure a platform option in [platformio.ini](https://docs.platformio.org/page/projectconf.html) file:

## Stable version

```ini
[env:stable]
platform = raspberrypi
board = ...
...
```

## Development version

```ini
[env:development]
platform = https://github.com/platformio/platform-raspberrypi.git
board = ...
...
```

# Configuration

Please navigate to [documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/page/platforms/raspberrypi.html).
